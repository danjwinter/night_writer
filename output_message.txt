This is Michael Bluth. For 10 years, he's worked for his father's company waiting to be made a partner. And right now, he's happy. This is Michael's mother. Look what they've done, Michael. She isn't happy. Look what the homosexuals have done to me. You can't just comb that out and reset it? Currently, she's upset that her husband's retirement party is being upstaged by a group of gay protesters. We're here! We're queer! We want to get married on the ocean! Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. Good grief, Mother. Not all homosexuals are flamboy Oh, my God! I have the exact same blouse. This is Michael's twin sister, Lindsay. I like it better on him.
